Simulated surround sound mode:

sudo pi_bose -i /home/pi/pi-rc/bose/5_speakers.json -r 24

Mute is a toggle.
Pause is a toggle.
AM/FM is a toggle.
Random is basically shuffle for CDs.

Not sure what max volume is, but 60 is extremely loud and it can get louder.

Other functions I've yet to find codes for:

seek forward
seek back
auto-off

Skip also will toggle through radio presets.
If there are no presets, it will increment/decrement the station number.
